# Rust Mini Projects ðŸ¦€

Welcome to my collection of small Rust projects and experiments!

This repository serves as a space for me to explore different Rust concepts and build small projects.
These projects are not meant to be production ready and may not be feature complete.

## ðŸ“‚ Current Mini Projects

* **File Sync Tool (`file-sync-tool/`)**: A command-line tool built with Rust to synchronise files between two directories. 
This project focuses on file system interaction and path manipulation.

## How to Explore

Each mini project resides in its own subdirectory. Within each subdirectory, you'll find:

* A dedicated `README.md` file explaining the project in more detail, including its purpose, key features, and how to run it.
* The Rust source code.
* A `Cargo.toml` file for managing dependencies.

To explore a specific project, navigate to its subdirectory and refer to its `README.md` file.
